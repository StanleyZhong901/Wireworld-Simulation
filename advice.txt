(1) Learn the rules of Wireworld. Understand the cycle movements.

(2) Understand the context of the text file.

(3) Experiment with newSleep function.

Then, you can start the final assessment implementation:

(a) Check command line arguments. Verify the amount. can use atoi() and atof()

(b) FileIO on text file. Make sure you read the number correctly. fscanf is recommended.

(c) Malloc 2D color map array and assign the number correctly.

(d) Try print the number to terminal to check for correctness.

(e) Print the cell grid array with spaces and correct background color.

(f) Apply the Wireworld rules to update the array to next cycle update, and print it again. Check for correctness.

(g) Use FOR loop to iterate all the update cycles with newSleep function. Remember to clear the screen everytime.

(h) Make sure to free all the allocated resources.

NOTE: Please start writing your makefile early, and then update it as needed.
